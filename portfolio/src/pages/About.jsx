              I'm Sophia, a web developer who recently graduated from Ironhack's bootcamp. Originally from the Philippines, I've been living in the Netherlands since 2015. I'm excited to bring my creativity, adaptability, and problem-solving skills into the tech industry.

            <p class= "text-right">
              My background is in retail, where I've worked for over five yearsâ€”starting as a rider, then a picker, and now as a supervisor. This experience has taught me how to lead teams, manage time effectively, and stay focused under pressure. Working in a fast-paced environment helped me develop strong organizational and decision-making skills.

              Although I'm new to the tech field, I've built six projects during the bootcamp and discovered a passion for building solutions that are both functional and user-friendly. I'm eager to keep growing, learn from experienced developers, and contribute meaningfully to a team. I'm confident that my unique mix of retail leadership and web development training makes me a strong and motivated candidate for a junior developer role.
